# tictactoe
Adversarial search problem, tictactoe. The agent is given an initial state, a game board represented as a 2D list, containing three different variables, X, O, and EMPTY. The purpose is to reach a goal state, win or draw.

Minimax algorithm is implemented. There are two hypothetical players, a minimum and maximum player. The goal of the maximum player is to get the highest score and vice versa. The algorithm represents scores as -1, 1 for the minimum and maximum player, respectively, and 0 for a draw. The algorithm recursively searches all possible game states from the initial game state to the terminal state. The actions of the players will be dictated by the minimum or maxmimum value given different terminal states.
